                     Byte Size Arxiv takes the articles published to ArXiv.org, isolates unique sentences in the abstract using TF-IDF

                Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency
                Creates a score for each word (ignoring stopwords). If a given word appears frequently in the abstract itâ€™s score goes up. However, if the word is also common amongst the abstracts of all of the other articles, the score goes down.
                The words with the highest scores are the most import words unique to the article in question!
